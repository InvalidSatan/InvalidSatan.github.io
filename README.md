# TierComp

This project hosts a simple React presentation used to compare AI tooling tiers. It was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and configured for deployment to **GitHub Pages**.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The static site is generated in the `dist` folder.

## GitHub Pages

A GitHub Actions workflow builds the project and publishes the `dist` directory to the `gh-pages` branch. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings and choose the `gh-pages` branch.
